# ArkHandler
Crossplay Server Management Script

This script automates a few of the pains of running Windows store crossplay ark.
• Auto-reboots on crash via screen mapping
• Syncs ini files from a backup or main location before it boots
• Checks for updates automatically and installs them
• Sends webhook notifications to discord if the server crashes or has an update
• Optionally, ArkHandler can also automatically wipe the servers based on time schedules set

I am not currently providing direct support for this script.


# How To Setup
To use ArkHandler, you just need to download the executable from my latest releases.
```ini
1. download the .exe from latest releases
2. place anywhere you like
3. run the app for a second and then close it, it will generate a 'config.ini' file that you can customize
4. open the 'config.ini' file and enter the preferences youd like for your server
5. Done. You can now double click on the app and it will boot up ark for you
```

This script is just to make it a little easier to host crossplay ark servers.

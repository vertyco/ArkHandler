# ArkHandler

Crossplay Server Management Script

This script automates a few of the pains of running Windows store crossplay ark.
• Auto-reboots on crash via screen mapping
• Syncs ini files from a backup or main location before it boots
• Checks for updates automatically and installs them
• Sends webhook notifications to discord if the server crashes or has an update
• Optionally, ArkHandler can also automatically wipe the servers based on time schedules set

I am not currently providing direct support for this script.

# How To Setup

1. Download the latest release from [latest releases](https://github.com/vertyco/ArkHandler/releases)
2. If you want to download the example config.ini you can, otherwise the app will make one automatically
3. configure the config.ini file how you want
4. you are ready to run, just double click ArkHandler.exe to start the app

This script is just to make it a little easier to host crossplay ark servers.

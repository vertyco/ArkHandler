# ArkHandler

Crossplay Server Management Script

This is a little script I wrote to handle my ark servers

- Auto-reboots on crash via screen mapping
- Syncs ini files from a backup or main location before it boots
- Checks for updates automatically and installs them
- Sends webhook notifications to discord if the server crashes or has an update
- Optionally auto-wipe the servers based on time schedules set

I am not currently providing direct support for this script.
